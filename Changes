hex() method returned undef if the first value returned
from rgb() was 0. Thanks to Marc-Olivier Bernard <mob@kilargo.fr>
for noticing it.

Warnings issued by names() is fixed
(again thanks to Marc-Olivier Bernard mob@kilargo.fr )


hex2rgb() also was issueing warnings, and replacing built-in
hex() with CORE::hex() solve the problem, sine the library itself
has its own hex() method

Some touches to the manual...
